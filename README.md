# Psychic Game
The program generates a letter at random. The user then has 9 guesses to match the generated letter. If guesses are exhausted before the user guesses the generated letter, the losses are incremented by one.  If the user guesses the generated letter before the guesses are exhausted, the wins are incremented by one.

### How to Play

**Guesses Left** - The user has 9 tries to guess the computer's letter. This value will dynamically update on the page.

**Your Guesses So Far** - The specific letters that the user typed, which is dynamically displayed on each keyUp event until the user either wins or loses.

**Wins** - Number of times the user has guessed the letter correctly.

**Losses** - Number of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all 9 guesses.
